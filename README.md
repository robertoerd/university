# universitypractices
This is more like a testing repository, where i'll upload my resolution for several tests, quizzes, projects and university practice materials, and for GIT and GitHub practices as well. If something here can help you with studies or you want to improve some code, you can use it freely, just remember to keep your work free to everyone.
