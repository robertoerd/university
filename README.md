# University - Practices in Computer Science

This is more of a test repository, here I will upload my resolutions to quizzes, exams, projects and other practice materials from my university.

(Oh, also to learn how this GIT and GitHub stuff works, I'm not going to lie)

If something here helps you to practice or get better with your studies, or you just want to improve some of my solutions, that's fine, you can do it freely, just remember to keep your code free and available for everyone.
